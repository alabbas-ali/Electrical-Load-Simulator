## JDemandModel

A JAVA application to simulate the electricity demand of a dwelling.

Running the program without options will simply produce an output file (CSV) which can be found in the folder data/output with simulation data for one day (10-minute-intervals). To show the available options start the application like this:
	
	java -jar jdm-v0.1.jar --help

Some examples and JUnit tests are included in the project folder, as well as a java documentation.

## Reference
